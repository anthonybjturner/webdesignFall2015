My name is Anthony Turner. I'm a Computer Science student at Suny New Paltz.
I love programming for desktop, mobile, and the web. 
For my career, I'm considering becoming a web programmer.
In my spare time, I like to code, play video games and spend time with my girlfriend.
My favorite games are Diablo III, Elders Scroll Online, GTA V, and NBA 2k15, all on the Playstation 4.
